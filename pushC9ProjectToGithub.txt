1.	In the bottom left of your C9 dashboard is a section called “Add-on Services”. Click “activate” next to the “GitHub” icon (if you haven’t already).
2.	When the pop up appears, tell it to allow access to your account. This should complete the link between GitHub account and your C9 account.
3.	While still on the dashboard, look to the right under “Account Settings” for the link “Show your SSH key”. Click on it, and copy the value which appears.
4.	Go to the GitHub SSH settings page, and click “Add SSH Key”
5.	Enter the title “C9”, paste the SSH Key into the “Key” box, and click “Add Key”.
6.	Create a new, empty repository for your project.From your repository’s home page, copy the SSH link. By default GitHub shows the HTTPS link, you will need to toggle it to ssh first!It will look something like:
"git@github.com:yourname/yourrepository.git".
7.	Open your C9 project window, and go to the terminal.Set your git config username:
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
8.	Set your git config email (which should match your github account email):
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
9.	Make your current directory a git repository by running:
git init
10.	Using the SSH link you copied in step 7, add the remote repository as the origin:
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/yourrepository.git
11.	Add your files and commits, as you normally would:
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
12.	Push your changes:
git push -u origin master
13.	Admire your updated repository on GitHub
